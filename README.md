## Welcome!

Welcome to the IVADO/Mila Deep Learning school! This 6th edition is given online for the first time and is hosted on the platform Swapcard.

In this repo, you will find all the material needed for completing the [tutorials](tutorials) of the school as well as [slides](slides).

## Course Structure

All lectures are given virtually. Each lecture assumes you have completed the appropriate module on the [MOOC](https://cours.edulib.org/courses/course-v1:UMontreal+IVADO-DL1EN+A2020/about) and is followed by a tutorial. These tutorials apply concepts that have been covered throughout the school.

Each [tutorials](tutorials) will be presented in two files:
* The `_to_complete` file in which templates are provided but code is left out for you to complete.
* The `_solutions` file where the suggested solutions to the tutorials are included. _Note: Will be uploaded after each respective live coding session_

## Practical Information

The tutorials are in the format of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org). In order to facilitate usage/setup of the notebooks, we will be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mila-iqia/ivado-mila-dl-school-2021) which gives users access to pre-configured python environment with all the necessary dependencies. It also gives access to free GPUs for cloud computation. Using Colab will require an internet connection and a Google Account. You can however use the notebooks locally if you so prefer but additional setup will be necessary.
